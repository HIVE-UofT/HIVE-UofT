Somayeh is a first-year Master of Health Informatics (MHI) student at IHPME, Dalla Lana School of Public Health. She holds a PharmD degree and, as a pharmacist, worked in different management and leadership positions in community pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies back in Iran, her home country, during the past few years. 
She started the MHI program to pursue her dream of becoming an impactful health informatician, harnessing the power of technology to help provide patients with better care and experience. She is passionate about AI/ML deployment in helping cancer patients in the palliative care setting, especially those in hospice/end-of-life care. She believes health informatics could provide her with the necessary knowledge and skills to bridge the gap and improve these patients' care and outcomes, including their survival, quality of life, treatment costs, etc.
