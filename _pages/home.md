### Welcome to HIVE Lab at UofT!

The Health Informatics, Visualization, and Equity (HIVE) Lab in the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation,  Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto is a group of data scientists, epidemiologists, and software developers working at the interface of Machine Learning, AI, Information Visualization, and Helth Informatics. As a research group, we are passionate about integrating data across different sources and scales to develop novel methods and open source tools to promote health at individual and population levels and to foster national and international collaborations to advance the quest for health equity.
